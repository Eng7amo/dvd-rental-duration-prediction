# DVD Rental Duration Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project applies regression-based machine learning models to predict how many days a customer will rent a DVD. Accurate rental duration prediction enables better inventory planning, reduced stock shortages, and improved operational efficiency for rental businesses.

The project evaluates multiple regression models and selects the best-performing approach based on Mean Squared Error (MSE).

---

## Business Problem
A DVD rental company needs to predict rental duration using customer behavior, movie attributes, and pricing data. The goal is to achieve a prediction model with an MSE of **3 or less** on unseen data to support data-driven inventory planning.

---

## Solution Summary
- Feature engineering from timestamps and categorical attributes
- Multiple regression models evaluated
- Random Forest Regressor selected as best model
- Final test MSE: **≈ 2.03**

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- GitHub (Web Interface only)
